# Stripe Node.js Integration

This is an example project demonstrating how to integrate Stripe payment gateway with a Node.js application.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

Before running the application, you need to set up your Stripe account and obtain the required API keys. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Sign up for a Stripe account at [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com) if you haven't already.
2. Go to the Stripe Dashboard and retrieve your API keys. You will need the **Publishable Key** and the **Secret Key**.
3. Open the `config.js` file in the project's root directory and replace the placeholders with your Stripe API keys:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     publishableKey: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY',
     secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
   };
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the example application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. The application allows you to make test payments using Stripe's test card numbers.

## Customization

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs. You can extend the functionality and integrate additional features provided by the Stripe API. Refer to the official Stripe documentation for more information on how to use the API: [https://stripe.com/docs/api](https://stripe.com/docs/api).
